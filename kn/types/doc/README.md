# `doc` Statically Rendered HTML and Other Docs

Even though the KEG knowledge nodes have nothing formally to do with the
Web there are definitely opportunities to take advantage of it. One of
those advantages is the special `doc` node within the [root
node](../root). This has become the conventional place to put rendered
documents on the static Web and works nicely as an overlap between KEG
and the Web. It allows an entire root node to be rendered as HTML and/or
PDF and stored in an isolated location so as to not clutter the rest of
the nodes. Static site generation tools as KEG management utilities
should take advantage of this and generate into that node specifically.
