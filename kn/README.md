# Knowledge Node Specification

This document specifies the simple structure of a *knowledge node*.

Knowledge workers create and maintain nodes on their local workstations
using little more than their preferred text editor. There is nothing to
install. Anyone who can create directories and files and input text into
them can easily create a knowledge node with a minimal amount of
learning, just a simplified version of Markdown and YAML both of which
were designed for humans.

Note that this specification does not include information about how
knowledge nodes are shared on the Knowledge Exchange Grid. That
information has it [own specification](../keg).
