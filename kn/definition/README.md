# Definition of *Knowledge Node*

A *knowledge node* (colloquially called a *KEG node*) is a directory
(folder) containing other files and directories. Knowledge workers fill
these with *knowledge source* during their work-day in real time without
too much thought about their organization. They can be organized  later
allowing free thought,  mind mapping, and flow state to occur without
much cognitive overhead for format and structure. This process fosters
creative thinking while capturing thoughts as they happen that might
otherwise be lost and unsearchable.

Indeed, this specification draws heavily on solutions to problems the
software development community has already addressed --- particularly
with regard to source management and distribution. Knowledge *is*
source.
