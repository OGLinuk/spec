# KN Structured Data File

A knowledge node may contain a single structured `data.yml`,
`data.json`, or `data.tsv` file that can be edited with nothing more
than a simple text editor, or generated from any external source. Field
names are [strictly specified](../naming) to promote compatibility and
indicate an exported or internal scope (although always public).
