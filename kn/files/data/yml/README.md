# YAML

YAML is the most human friendly format and should be considered the
default. Files must not begin with `---` and must not use YAML linking
of any kind. When in doubt, the resulting conversion to JSON must be
valid. The `data.yml` file must only use the `.yml` suffix (`.yaml` is
unsupported).
