# Tab-Delimited (TSV)

Tab-delimited (TSV) files contain one record per line where each field
on every line is separated by a tab character. The first line must
always contain the field names which must consist only of legal [KN Data
Field Names](../names/data). This format is commonly supported for
database exports and imports.
