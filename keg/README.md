# KEG, The Knowledge Exchange Grid (Graph)

KEG addresses the best and most broken parts of the Web. It fulfills our
need to capture, maintain, and share knowledge easily, safely, and
quickly while requiring the least amount of technology possible. Knowing
how to create and edit text files is all that is required to participate
and *nothing* is centralized.

More formally, the Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG) is a secure,
performant, grassroots, progressively enhanced, decentralized,
transport-agnostic, world-wide graph network of composable, semantic,
knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally searched by
those who create and maintain them in real time, and others within their
personal/professional learning networks who share theirs and follow
others within their self-governing knowledge trust where abuses are
cancelled and quality content rewarded.
