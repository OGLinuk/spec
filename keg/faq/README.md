# FAQ

## What is the difference between "keg" and "kn"?

The term "keg" always refers to the sharing network on which a "kn"
(knowledge node) is shared. 

## What is the difference between a "KEG node" and a "knowledge node"?

A KEG node is a knowledge node that is shared on the KEG. Knowledge
nodes can exist locally without ever being shared. A KEG node must be
shared to be called such.

## Why not "knowledge base"?

Because the term is inaccurate. The word "base" implied it can't be
further composed or otherwise combined. Therefore, the best and most
accurate term is "knowledge node" even if a single node is a root node
shared over KEG.
