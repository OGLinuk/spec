# Best Practices

These best practices are suggested but not formally part of any
specification.

## Use Simple Title Headings

The main title heading (which must always be the first line of the
`README.md` file or explicitly set as `Title` in the data files) should
always be considered within the context of the [entry
node](../kn/types/entry).

## Avoid FAQ Sections

It's usually better to just include a properly punctuated question as a
heading. Include the questions where they make the most sense rather
than forcing them into a single section or node that would have to be
categorized anyway.

When and if you do have more than a few FAQs related to a specific node
consider creating a `faq` node for them with just an FAQ title and level
two headings for each question.
