# Tenets

> Tenet: a principle, belief, or doctrine generally held to be true; especially : one held in common by members of an organization, movement, or profession. (Marriam Webster Dictionary)

* **Speak plainly.** Communicate without unnecessary, bombastic, insider
  obfuscation whenever possible. Error on the side of colloquialism and
  inclusion rather than academic formalism. Call stuff what anyone on
  the street would. In other words, don't be a jack ass. Save your
  vocabulary flexing for those who appreciate it. Invite them to follow
  you on KEG. Just keep it out of these specs.

* **Restore control to the consumer.** Originally, the Web placed power
  in the hands of the consumer to control how content is consumed.
  Slowly nefarious content creators and corporations stole that control
  (along with our privacy). We must take back this control of everything
  about our consumption from font size preferences to personalized SEO
  criteria.

* **Foster trust.** Best knowledge rises to the top based on what is
  trusted by those *you* trust, not some broken system manipulated by
  mob mentality, upvotes, and reputation trolling. Bots are silenced.
  Popularity is based on what you trust, not random strangers. 

* **No single transport dependency.** The exchange of knowledge must never
  be locked to any single transport method. This prevents *any* party
  from controlling the free exchange of knowledge. Existing transport
  methods can and should be leveraged, but never required. Knowledge on
  USB sticks transported by pneumatic tubes or bipeds (even quadrupeds)
  must always be permitted.

* **Minimum possible technology requirement.** Participants should be
  able to simply use paper and pen or pencil so long as they write
  clearly and use KEG Markdown (a simplified version of Pandoc Markdown,
  which is already a universal standard). Most will use a basic
  computer, but there is no reason OCR software couldn't be used, or
  just no software at all and just paper and file folders.

* **Progressive enhancement.** Software *must* assume the least possible
  functionality and progressively enhance the user experience as
  additional functionality is detected.

* **Treat knowledge as source.** Most of the world's knowledge management
  challenges have already been faced and have elegant solutions when we
  think of knowledge simply as human source code.

* **Apply the UNIX philosophy to knowledge nodes.** Each finite
  knowledge node should cover one bit of knowledge completely and well
  so that it could be reasonably used as-is, in-line composed into a
  linear document.
